# Prim-s-Algorithm
Using Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree when given an undirected graph G=[N, E].

Input#1 (argv[1]): an undirected graph, represented by a list of edges with costs [Ni, Nj, C] (an edge from Ni to Nj with edge cost of C).
The first line of the text file specifies the "number of nodes N" in graph G followed by a list of triplets [Ni, Nj, C].

Output#1 (argv[2]): a MST (minimum spanning tree) of G with the first line of text being the "number of nodes N", and then a list of edges, edge cost, and total cost of MST.

Output#2 (argv[3]): debugging results.
